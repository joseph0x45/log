# log
Log anything anytime from anywhere. This is a very simple tool I made to be able to log
stuff anytime I want. I originally had the idea of something like this when I started my weight
loss journey.

## Interface
- Add a new log entry
`log <title> <content>`

Features:
- [x] Add log entry
- [x] Show content of current day's log file
- [x] Show content of a specific day's log file
- [ ] List all logs
- [ ] Clean log older than X days
- [ ] Human readable filters (log show yesterday/today-2...)
